                        <a href="https://www.candlescience.com/learning/melt-and-pour-soap-making-for-beginners/" target="_blank">Melt & Pour</a> soap is a great option for beginners. 
                        All you have to do is melt the premade base, customise it with your favorite ingredients, 
                        and pour into a mold. Once you get the hang of the process, you can experiment with advanced techniques like layers and swirls.
                        <br>
                        Like “true” soap, Melt and Pour soap has been made through the saponification process with a combination of ingredients that are 
                        also used in traditional soaps – which might be considered to be more “true” – and these include natural oils as well as lye, thus Melt 
                        and Pour soap does not need to have lye added to it.
                        <br>
                        Additional Glycerin is added to the Melt and Pour soaps, offering more soothing and hydrating properties to the skin. It also helps produce clear soaps that can be easily colored and shaped and that are gentle on the skin, 
                        making Melt and Pour soap ideal for use on sensitive skin types.
                        <br>
                        There are several options to choose from when selecting a base: clear or white soap bases. The clear base will have more bright colors, while the white will have more pastel colors. 
                        You can also try bases with additives like shea butter, goat milk, or aloe vera.
                        <br>
                        Soap bases start to melt around 120°F (49°C). Use heat-safe tools and handle with care – melted soap can hurt if dripped or splashed on skin. When crafting with children, they should be old enough to hold their own containers and an adult should be present at all times.

            1. Prepare Your Supplies and Sanitize Your Work Space. Wash and dry molds, spatula, and plastic/glass containers with warm soapy water and dry completely. Sanitize your work area by spraying it with rubbing alcohol or a 5% bleach solution and then wipe dry with a clean paper towel.

            2. Measure Fragrance Oil Amount. You want to have your fragrance prepared ahead of time so the soap does not start to harden as you work. It is important to only use glass as fragrances can damage certain types of plastic and paper if it sits for long periods of time.

            3.  Prepare Your Soap Base. Remove the soap base of your choice from packaging and cut the soap base into small, even-sized cubes. You can choose from many read-made soap bases with different ingredients and qualities. Depending on the end result you can choose opaque or transparent soap bases.

            4. Melt the soap base. You can choose to melt your soap mixture on a low-heated hob or in a microwave (usually the quickest way which only takes about 1 minute). Take care to not overheat the soap - you should stop heating it as soon as all of the soap lumps melt but before it starts bubbling heavily.

            5. Add Additives such as colourants and fragrance/essential oils or exfoliants into melted soap. You will need to be quick as the soap mixture starts cooling down and solidifying quickly and ideally should not be reheated again.

            6. Pour Soap Base Into Molds and Allow To Cool Down. Pour slowly to minimize bubbles. Fill to the rim of the mold. Quickly spray the surface with rubbing alcohol to break up any bubbles that may have formed on the surface.
After this let the mixture cool down and within a couple hours it can be removed from the mold and can be used immediately. Melt and pour soaps do not need curing, but they require airtight packaging if you want to keep them in a good condition use later in the future.
