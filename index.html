                    Soap is a product for cleaning made from natural ingredients that may include both plant and animal products, including items as: animal fat, such as tallow or vegetable oil, such as castor, olive, or coconut oil.
                    <br>
                    <a href="https://lovelygreens.com/easy-soap-recipes-beginners/" target="_blank">Soapmaking</a> in recent years has become a quite popular hobby and/or business for some people from what used to be quite limited knowledge only to soapmakers who dedicated their lives to it.
                    These days access to this knowledge and chemical elements required to create soap has become widely accessible and these days in many Arts & Crafts fairs we can see small soapmaker businesses or individuals selling their crafted soaps.
                    <br>
                    More and more people are looking to buy hand-made soaps and their popularity rose globally to a market of $34.09 billion in 2021. It is estimated to reach an impressive number of $55.29 billion in 2027.
                    <br>
                    Hand-crafted soaps make unique and amazing gifts, but it is not the only reason people buy and use it.
                    For example, some are only able to use artisan soaps without certain ingredients (like parabens, petrochemicals, aluminium, and sulfates) because of the skin conditions they have.
                    And for some it's a cleaner, more locally-sourced and more organic lifestyle choice due to the environmental impact that large-scale soap production has.
                    <br>
                    Like choosing the ingredients in any recipe, choosing the oils in your soap recipes is a very important step in your soap making. Each oil imparts different qualities to the final soap - creating your soap recipe is the art of balancing them to create the perfect bar of soap.
                    Most popular oils used in soapmaking are: olive oil, palm oil, macadamia nut oil, coconut oil, apricot kernel oil, castor oil, avocado oil, grapeseed oil, shea butter, jojoba oil.

                    Babylonians were making soap around 2800 B.C. and were the first one to master the art of soap making. They made soap from fats boiled with ashes. Soap was used in cleaning wool and cotton used in textile manufacture and was used medicinally for at least 5000 years.
                    <br>
                    The Ebers papyrus (Egypt, 1550 BC) reveals that the ancient Egyptians mixed animal and vegetable oils with alkaline salts to produce a soap-like substance.
                    <br>
                    According the Pliny the Elder, the Phoenicians used goat's tallow and wood ashes to create soap in 600 BC. Early Romans made soaps in the first century A.D. from urine and soap was widely known in the Roman Empire
                    <br>
                    The Celts made their soap from animal fat and plant ashes and they named the product saipo, from which the word soap is derived.
                    <br>
                    By the 7th century, soap-making was an established art in Italy, Spain and France. These countries were early centers of soap manufacturing due to their ready supply of source ingredients, such as oil from olive trees.Â 
                    <br>
                    A major step toward large-scale soap making occurred in 1791 when a French chemist, Nicholas Leblanc, patented a process for making soda ash from common salt.
                    <br>
                    Soda ash is obtained from ashes and can be combined with fat to form soap. This discovery made soap-making one of America's fastest-growing industries by 1850, along with other advancements and development of power to operate factories.

                  <b>Interesting fact:</b> <i>Soap supposedly got its name from Mount Sapo in Rome. The word sapo, Latin for soap, first appeared in Pliny the Elder's Historia Naturalis. Rain would wash down the mountain mixing with animal fat and ashes, resulting in a clay mixture found to make cleaning easier.</i>
