                  Soapmaking is surprisingly similar to Cold Process Soapmaking, except for one important distinction: after the oils and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lye" target="_blank">lye</a> solution have been mixed, the soap is then heated (forced to “cook”) before it is poured into the mold.
                    <br>
                    This forced heat/cooking speeds up the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/saponification" target="_blank">saponification process</a> significantly.
                    <br>
                    After the soap is placed into the mold, a few hours later it hardens and should be removed, and then cut. Hot process soaps can be used the next day, although a full month curing would certainly improve the performance of the soap.
                    <br>
                    Typically Hot Process Soaps have more of a funky/chunky “rustic” look, although additives can be used to give it more of a smooth texture.
                    <br>
                    Hot process soap making might be considered old and traditional. Yet, it gets the job done by nourishing your skin and keeping it hydrated. It allows the preservation of natural ingredients because the chemical reaction turns into soap & glycerin or the process of saponification takes place before we add all the extra skin nourishing ingredients .

                    Some <a href="https://thenovastudio.com/what-is-hot-process-soap-what-are-the-benefits/" target="_blank">Benefits of Hot Process</a> Soapmaking Include:
                    <li>A shorter curing time (realistically your soap can be packaged & sold a few weeks after it’s made),</li>
                    <li>You can use LESS scent (because it typically gets added after saponification, after cooking, so less dissipates),</li>
                    <li>It’s OK to use fragrances or essential oils that are problematic (those that “act up” or speed up trace with the CP method),</li>
                    <li>No seizing (since the scent is added after saponification has taken place), </li>
                    <li>No cracked or volcano-in-a-soap-mold overhearing) issues, </li>
                    <li>No soap ash (the chalky white stuff that can form on the surface of CP soap), </li>
                    <li>Easy cleanup (it’s already soap – just wash it up – no worry about “raw” caustic soap touching & harming your skin/surfaces).</li>

                  This method is the crock pot version of hot process soap making. The step-by-step instructions of individual projects may vary. Before you begin, assemble your ingredients.
                If needed, prepare safety gear such as goggles, gloves, and long sleeves. Cover your work surface with newspaper.

                  Important Safety note: Always add the sodium hydroxide (lye) to the water. NOT the
                  water to the sodium hydroxide. A violent reaction occurs and you could sustain chemical
                  burns if you do not observe this precaution.

        1. Weigh and combine oils in slow cooker. Measure out any botanicals or colorants you will be using along with essential oils,
        extracts and/or exfoliants really accuratelly and put them into containers so they are within reach.
        (You can find a soap calculator <a href="http://soapcalc.net/calc/soapcalcwp.asp" target="_blank">here</a>)

        2. Mix lye into water and allow to cool. Before using sodium hydroxide, put on your safety equipment; goggles, gloves and long sleeve clothing as it is caustic and can do a lot of harm if not handled properly. Measure out the lye and pour it slowly into the container stirring as you pour.
Keep stirring until the lye crystals are completely dissolved. You will notice fumes and HEAT being produced while you are mixing the lye solution. Avoid breathing in the fumes.

        3. Add lye-water to oils and mix until tracing starts. If any solid oils/fats are used, melt them first by placing them into a crockpot on low heat or in a microvawe. Once the solid oils have melted, add the liquid oils. Make sure oils and lye solution are below 120°F (49°C).
   Combine lye solution and oil mixture by slowly pouring a thin stream of the lye solution into the pot of oils while using the whisk or stick blender to stir the mixture. Maintain a steady, strong stirring motion and Make sure to stir thoroughly all areas of the pot. The mixture will turn creamy and
opaque and then will begin to thicken.

        4. After reaching full trace cook the soap. Once the soap reaches a full trace, it's time to cook the mixture for about an hour and force the gel. The soap will heat up and start to bubble around the edges of the crock pot, keep an eye on the soap and stir it down gently only if it starts to bubble over.
    Once soap mixture starts looking a lot like Vaseline it is almost done, but to be fully sure it's recommended to check it with a pH test (it should register between pH 7-10 to be safe). If it passes the test - at this point the soap is safe to touch and use.

        5. Add Additives such as botanicals, colourants, fragrance/essential oils and exfoliants. If you want to make a swirl of colour or make coloured layers, divide off some soap and colour it now.
    Make sure to cool the soap to a temperature below the essential oils flash point. Flash point is the temperature that the essential oil will ignite and vaporize. If it is added at too high a temperature, your soap may not smell like you planned.
    You will have to work fast while mixing since the soap will cool quickly. Make sure that the additives are not cold.

        6. Scoop into mold and cool. Because the end product is a thick gooey mass (a lot like mashed potatoes) it must be scooped into
        the mold quickly. Make sure to gently tap the mold on the counter to get out any air pockets. Now you have to just leave it alone! It can take 24 hours or sometimes
        more to cool the soap mixture down and harden enough to be able to remove it from the mold.

        7. Cutting and curing. After removing the soap from the mold, it's time to cut it. You can use a knife or a corrugated soap cutter available at soap suppliers. Once you have cut the soap into bars, they can either be used immediately or be cured for a few weeks. The longer the cure, the
harder and milder the soap will be.
