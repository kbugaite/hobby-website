                  soap is made by combining oils and sodium hydroxide lye without using any heat. That causes a chemical reaction called saponification.
                    <br>
                    <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/saponification" target="_blank"><b>Saponification</b></a><i> is a process by which triglycerides react with sodium or potassium hydroxide (lye) to produce glycerol and a fatty acid salt called “soap”.</i>
                    <br>
                    This method of making soap from scratch involves handling lye (sodium hydroxide). In the past, lye was traditionally made with wood ashes, while today we use a standardized product.
                    No matter what it's made from, <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lye" target="_blank">lye</a> is a caustic substance that requires careful handling by responsible adults only.</b>
                    So you need protective clothing, gloves, a mask, eyewear and a very well ventilated space.
                    <br>
                    Soap makers tend to prefer one method over another. The cold process can be individualised to refine every amount of each ingredient , add fresh fruits and milk and many people consider it a more creative method as the thicker consistency allows for a great number of heavier ingredients to be incorporated.
                    <br>
                    Some of the world's best soap makers use the cold process method. For instance, <a href="https://naturalfrenchsoap.com/en-gb/blogs/soapedia/savon-de-marseille-the-history-of-marseille-soap" target="_blank">“Savon de Marseille”</a> was one of the best-kept secrets of southern France, and only in recent history have these artisanal soaps found their way to other parts of the world.
                    Its superb qualities - from olive oil, marine ash, and sea saltwater - are praised for gently nourishing the skin.

          1. First, weigh the lye in a heatproof container. Weigh water in a separate container.
          (Note: A lye calculator is handy here: simply enter the oil weight or percentage, and the tool will provide the lye and liquid amount needed for the recipe.
          You can find one <a href="http://soapcalc.net/calc/soapcalcwp.asp" target="_blank">here</a>)

          2. Next, carefully pour the lye into the water, stirring gently with a heatproof utensil until the lye has fully dissolved. Set aside, and let cool for up to an hour.

          4. Pour the lye solution into the container of oils. Stir until trace is reached. (Trace refers to the point when the oils and lye solution have emulsified. At this stage, there should be no streaks of oil, and the soap will have the consistency of batter.)
          Then add any extra ingredients—such as natural exfoliants or colorants—stirring to combine.

          5. Carefully pour the melted soap into the mold. (The soap is still caustic at this stage, so keep your safety gear on when handling.) Cover the mold with a sheet of paper. To retain heat, wrap a towel around it.
          Set aside for up to two days or until completely cool and solid.

        <p class="card-text">
          6. When ready, remove homemade soap from the mold and slice it into bars. After it's removed from the mold, cold process soap can be cut by using a knife or a corrugated soap cutter available at soap suppliers.
          Let the bar soaps cure in the open air for at least four weeks before using.
          It's done so the saponification process finishes fully and soap no longer is caustic to skin - it's not safe to use on skin until this step is finished!
